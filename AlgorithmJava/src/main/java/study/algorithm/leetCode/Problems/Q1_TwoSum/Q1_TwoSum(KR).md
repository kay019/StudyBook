# Q1. Two Sum

## Quiz

- #### Level : EASY


Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.



### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

### Constraints:
- ``` 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4 ```
- ``` 10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9 ```
- ``` 10^9 <= target <= 10^9 ```

Only one valid answer exists.

## Intuition
The Two Sum problem asks us to find two numbers in an array that sum up to a given target value. We need to return the indices of these two numbers.

## Approach
1. One brute force approach is to consider every pair of elements and check if their sum equals the target. This can be done using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element, and the inner loop iterates from the next element to the last element. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2).
2. A more efficient approach is to use a hash table (unordered_map in C++). We can iterate through the array once, and for each element, check if the target minus the current element exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a valid pair of numbers. If not, we add the current element to the hash table.

### Approach using a hash table:
1. Create an empty hash table to store elements and their indices.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right.
3. For each element nums[i], calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target: complement = target - nums[i].
4. Check if the complement exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a solution.
5. If the complement does not exist in the hash table, add the current element nums[i] to the hash table with its index as the value.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until we find a solution or reach the end of the array.
7. If no solution is found, return an empty array or an appropriate indicator.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) since hash table lookups take constant time on average. It allows us to solve the Two Sum problem efficiently by making just one pass through the array.

## Solution Article

### Approach 1: Brute Force
#### Algorithm
The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element x and find if there is another value that equals to target - x.

#### Implementation
``` java 
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == target - nums[i]) {
                    return new int[] { i, j };
                }
            }
        }
        // In case there is no solution, we'll just return null
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time complexity** : *O(n^2)*.
For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array which takes *O(n)* time. Therefore, the time complexity is *O(n^2)*.

- **Space complexity** : *O(1)*.
The space required does not depend on the size of the input array, so only constant space is used.

### Approach 2: Two-pass Hash Table
#### Intuition

To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. If the complement exists, we need to get its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? A hash table.

We can reduce the lookup time from *O(n)* to *O(1)* by trading space for speed. A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time. I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a lookup could degenerate to *O(n)* time. However, lookup in a hash table should be amortized *O(1)* time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.

#### Algorithm

A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table. Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement *(targetâˆ’nums[i])* exists in the hash table. If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must not be *nums[i]* itself!

#### Implementation
``` java 
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement) && map.get(complement) != i) {
                return new int[] { i, map.get(complement) };
            }
        }
        // In case there is no solution, we'll just return null
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time complexity** : *O(n)*.
We traverse the list containing nnn elements exactly twice. Since the hash table reduces the lookup time to *O(1)*, the overall time complexity is *O(n)*.
- **Space complexity** : *O(n)*.
The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores exactly nnn elements.


### Approach 3: One-pass Hash Table
#### Algorithm

It turns out we can do it in one-pass. While we are iterating and inserting elements into the hash table, we also look back to check if current element's complement already exists in the hash table. If it exists, we have found a solution and return the indices immediately.

#### Implementation
``` java 
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        // In case there is no solution, we'll just return null
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity** : *O(n)*.
We traverse the list containing nnn elements only once. Each lookup in the table costs only *O(1)* time.

- **Space complexity** : *O(n)*.
The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores at most nnn elements.
